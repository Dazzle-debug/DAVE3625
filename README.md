For this assignment I will try to estimate stock price using polynomial regression algorithm. 
The reason I chose to use regression is because it is a good starting point and because this is my first time using ML.
Since the stock price varies, the regression will try to find the best fit line which can predict the output.
The variable Y can be calculated from a regression model of input variables X. I found out that 8th polynomial gives me the best prediction. 
I have tried to implementate a date funtion and a function that calculates percentage, byt that was not succesfull. The time islimited because of many other project in other subjects.
